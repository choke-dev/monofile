File sharing via Discord
 
<br>

## Disclaimer!
This project does some stuff that can be considered questionable. Discord may not like you uploading files this way, and it's a grey area in Discord's TOS. We take no responsibility if Discord locks your account for API abuse. This was made out of pure boredom and wondering if it was even possible.
